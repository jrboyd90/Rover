# Rover

For this project I used a raspberry Pi and a DC motor controller board from ADAfruit. The webserver was built using Python and tornado and ADAfruit's python library to control each motor. 

A websocket and JQuery was used so the user could control the rover in real time by holding down the "WASD" keys to make it move in realtime. Some buttons were placed on the frontend so the user could also tap those for small predefined movements.
